def find_convergence(uni_connections, num_cell_B, rec_connections=0):
    """
    Calculates the convergence of a given edge being created from Cell Type A -> Cell Type B. Convergence is calculated by dividing the 
    total connections by the total amount of Cell Type B (both gotten from biology or another model). 
    
    Parameters:
        uni_connections: number of unidirectional connections from Cell Type A -> Cell Type B
        num_cell_B: number of Cell Type B in the original context
        rec_connections: number of reciprocal connections from the two cells(only applies if cells are of same type)

def homo_edge_probability_from_convergence(convergence, homo_num_cell_A, connect_to_same_type=False):
    """
    Calculates the probability of a given edge being created in a homogenous context from Cell Type A -> Cell Type B based on a given convergence value. 
    The convergence is divided by the total number of Cell Type A in the homogenous model to get the probability. If the connection is to a cell of the same type, 
    then it accounts for not wanting a synapse to itself. If they are not in the same network (i.e. a virtual Cell Type A connecting to a biophysical Cell Type A), 
    then this exception does not apply.
    
    Parameters:
        convergence: convergence of connections from Cell Type A -> Cell Type B
        homo_num_cell_A: number of Cell Type A in the homogenous model
        connect_to_same_type: boolean for whether the two cells are of the same type

        probability = convergence / (homo_num_cell_A - 1) #don't want synapse to itself
